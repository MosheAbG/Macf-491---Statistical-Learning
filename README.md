Q1: This question attempts to predict the weekely electricity consumption of Scandanavian countries using Fourier expansions and regressions.
Most machine learning methods are created from their defintions without using built in functions, such as for Ordinary Least Squares.
K fold cross-validation is then performed using the above function
The optimal parameters are obtained, and there is a graph showing the true values vs the predicted values.
Q2:
